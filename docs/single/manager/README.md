# CloudLinux Manager

[[toc]]

<span class="notranslate">CloudLinux Manager</span> is a plugin for most popular control panels including cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin and ISPmanager (InterWorx coming soon). It allows you to control and monitor all CloudLinux OS Single features.

![](/images/lvemanagermainmenu_zoom80.png)

Log in as administrator to get access to the following functionality:

* <span class="notranslate">Website Monitoring</span> provides access to Website Monitoring and PHP Slow Site Analyzer.
* <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tab - provides access to X-Ray;

## Website monitoring tool

**Website monitoring tool** is a new tool that collects the statistics of the domains' availability and responsiveness, as well as errors that occur when accessing these domains. An admin can get email reports with the statistics. The website monitoring tool uses the simple curl request like `curl http://domain.com` to get domains’ statistics.

You can configure the Website monitoring tool and Slow Site analyzer and view the daily reports in the CloudLinux Manager -> Website monitoring tab.

There are Main, PHP Site analyzer, and Settings subtabs here.

:::warning Warning
For now, there is no any possibility to remove the `alt-php-ssa` and `cl-web-monitoring-tool` packages so that the _Website monitoring_ tab will be removed. This possibility will be added in the future releases.

You can turn off the _Website monitoring_, _PHP Sites Analyzer_ in the _[Settings](/#settings)_ subtab, so sites statistics will stop collecting and there will be no additional load on the server.
:::

#### Main

This subtab views the latest report (for the previous day) of the Website monitoring tool.

![](/images/WebsiteMonitoringMain.png)

Remember that report is created every 24 hours and all changes in configuration (the _Settings_ tab) or in the list of domains will be applied for the next 24 hours (from midnight).

* **Total number of requests** - requests that were sent to all domains, existing on the servers
* **Successful requests** - the number of requests for all domains with ![](/images/Code200.png)
* **Requests with errors** - the number of requests for all domains which status code is not 200
* **Not started requests due to short check interval** - this metric is used to adjust configuration. If it is not equal 0, an admin should increase the value of Requests sending interval, because the tool does not fit into this interval to send requests to all domains.
* **Slowest websites in 24h and Websites with most errors in 24h** - in these sections you can find the number of domains that was exposed here.

## PHP Slow Site analyzer

![](/images/WebsiteMonitoringPHPSiteAnalyzer.png)

This is an example of a report from the Slow Site analyzer. The report shows the number of slow requests per domain and its URLs and the average duration of each slow URL.

You can find the explanation of the **Slow requests density in period** [here](/lve_manager/#what-is-the-density-threshold).


#### Settings

Here, an admin can configure the Website monitoring and the PHP Site analyzer.

:::tip Note
All settings which was changed after starting Website monitoring and Slow site analyzer will be applied for the next 24h (from midnight).
:::

To enable or disable **Website monitoring**, use the following slider.

![](/images/WebsiteMonitoringSlider.png)

* **Top N slow websites to show** - this number (N) will be used to select the top N domains from the list of all domains, sorted by response duration (Slowest websites list). And this number also will be used to select the top N domains from the list of all domains, sorted by amount of errors (Websites with most errors list).
* **Requests sending interval** - this is a period in minutes between requests to the same domain.
* **Domain response timeout** - if there is no answer from the website for this period of time, the Website Monitoring tool will regard this behaviour as the `HTTP 408` error.
* **Concurrent requests limit** - how many concurrent requests can be done by the Website Monitoring tool.

To enable or disable the **Slow site analyzer**, use the following slider.

![](/images/WebsiteMonitoringSlider1.png)

* **Top N slow websites to show** - this number (N) will be used to select the top N domains from the list of all domains, marked as slow.
* **Top slow URLs** - this number (N) will be used to select the top N URLs for each domain, marked as slow.
* **Slow request duration** - the duration of a request in seconds. 
* **Slow requests number & Analysis time** - how many requests with a certain request duration should be done in time to mark the domain as a slow one.
* **Slow requests density threshold** can be in the interval [0..1], by default it is 0.8. The **density threshold** can be disabled. And the **Domains and URLs Ignore List** can be specified.

#### What is the density threshold?

We try to find the most interesting requests for the optimisation from all number of requests to domains during 24 hours. The _Density threshold_ parameter helps to find the most visited URLs and the most popular requests. 

A density threshold is a numerical measure of some type of correlation, meaning the power of the statistical relationship between slow requests and all requests to the domain. If this parameter is enabled then the resulting table will contain slow requests that have exceeded the specified threshold. Requests with the highest density are usually the most distributed per day and are considered valuable to users, thus interesting for optimization.

Slow requests that represent bursts of activity and are weakly related to all activity per domain typically have a low density and will be weeded out.

#### Email notifications

Email notifications are created by the Web monitoring tools.

#### FAQ

Q: Does this feature consume a lot server resources for collecting website and PHP data? If I enable it can this slow down the server?

A: The load depends on the number of websites and the Website monitoring tool settings. Basically, the Website monitoring should not create a significant load and you can keep it always on.

---

Q: Can I change the default value to 10, for example for the "Top N slow websites to show" setting?

A: This number is simply the number of the slowest responding sites. All sites are sampled during the day. When generating a report, all sites' responses are sorted by response time from highest to lowest, and to make the report readable, only the first N sites are taken. You can specify N as all existing sites or only the 5 slowest. This number does not affect the server load, it only affects the report that will be visible in the UI or emailed to the administrator.

---

Q: What would you recommend: to enable the Website monitoring tool for some days and then disable or I can keep it always turned on?

A: The load depends on the number of websites and the Website monitoring tool settings. Basically, the Website monitoring tool should not create a significant load and you can keep it always on.

* [<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client](#x-ray-client)
* [<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> service](#x-ray-agent)

### Description

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is a tool developed for website performance monitoring and performance issues detection.

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> can gather and visualize information about top N slowest system functions, external requests, software modules and database queries of the client’s website.

### Installation

1. For instant X-Ray activation, run the following command:

   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # rhn_check
    ```
    </div>

    If the `rhn_check` command is not found, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install rhn-check rhn-setup
    ```
    </div>

2. Then install the <span class="notranslate">`alt-php-xray`</span> package

    * Via user interface
        * Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab.
        * Click <span class="notranslate">_Install_</span> to start installation.

        ![](/images/XRayUI.png)

    * Via SSH by running the following command:
  
    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install lvemanager alt-php-xray
    ```
    </div>

3. After installation, use the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create your first tracing task for a slow site.

![](/images/XRayStartTracing.png)

### How to manage X-Ray

X-Ray provides two options for monitoring domain requests speed: Tracing task and Continuous task.

* **Tracing task** is a task created manually for a specific URL to collect server requests. The task will end either after a specified number of requests to the URL or after a specified time (maximum after two days). It is not possible here to automatically email a report but it is possible to export the report in PDF and send to a user.

* **Continuous task** is a task that initiates a daily hourly tracing requests for a specified domain and email a monitoring report. Continuous task can't stop automatically, you need to stop it manually.

In fact, continuous task allows to automatically create a tracing task for each new day, with the ability to get a report for the past day.

#### Tracing tasks tab

The *Tracing tasks* tab contains a list of all tracing tasks created both manually and automatically via continuous tasks.

![](/images/XRayTracingTaskCreated.png)

The *Created* column shows how a task was created – automatically (by continuous task) or manually.

#### Continuous tracing tab
  
The *Continuous tracing* tab contains a list of continuous tasks for which tracing tasks will be created automatically for a new day for a specific domain.

![](/images/XRayContinuousTasksList.png)

### Managing tracing task

#### Creating a new tracing task

1. Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab
2. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create a new task
3. In the opened popup specify a website URL to trace
4. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Run_</span> button
5. Tracing will run in the default mode. In the default mode <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> traces the first 20 requests for a specified URL

![](/images/XRayTracingTask.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**URL**</span> should be a valid URL of the domain which exists on the current hosting server. The URL field supports wildcard matching. To learn more about wildcard matching, click _How to use special characters_.
* <span class="notranslate">**Advanced settings**</span> allow you to set an IP address and tracing options: by time or by number of queries.

    ![](/images/XRayAdvanced.png)

**Advanced settings**

* <span class="notranslate">**Client’s IP**</span>: it is an IPv4 address of a machine to trace. For example, if you have a production website that processes requests from different IP addresses and you do not want to add these requests to the tracing task. So, you can set a specific IP address and <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will analyze requests only from this specific IP address.
Record for
* <span class="notranslate">**Time period**</span>: how much time <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> collect the requests (2 days max)
* <span class="notranslate">**Requests**</span>: the amount of requests that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will collect

After creating, the task appears in the list of tracing tasks.

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList.png)

#### Viewing tracing tasks list

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList1.png)

Tasks created *Manually* are simply tracing tasks.

#### Tracing status

A tracing task can have the following statuses:

* <span class="notranslate">**Running**</span> – tracing is in progress
* <span class="notranslate">**Stopped**</span> – tracing was stopped by administrator
* <span class="notranslate">**On hold**</span> – the same URL already exists in the lists. Task processing will not start automatically. Administrator should start it manually.
* <span class="notranslate">**Completed**</span> – period of time is finished or number of requests is reached.

### X-Ray automated throttling detection

The X-Ray automated throttling detection system checks if the account exceeds LVE limits by CPU during the HTTP request execution. 

If CPU limiting was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI that the system itself has slowed down the request processing and this is apparently not a performance issue in the PHP code.

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are indicated in the administrator/user interface of the X-Ray plugin in the following way.

![](/images/RecordedSessions.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are also marked if the administrator views the request.

![](/images/LVEFaultsMarker.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are marked in the PDF report as well.

![](/images/XRayMonitoringReport.png)


### X-Ray client

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client is a PHP extension named <span class="notranslate">`xray.so`</span>. It analyzes the processing time of the entire request and its parts and then sends the data to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent.

### FAQ

#### Does X-Ray affect website performance?

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> affects website performance. Our tests show 5-10 % overhead from a website loading time with <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing enabled.
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> allows you to find website performance issues and should not be enabled permanently. If your website is very slow, you can enable <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> to find the cause and then disable it.

#### What should I do if I see the warning "Task is duplicated by URL"?

This warning means that you already have a task to trace this URL in the list of your tracing tasks. If you see this warning, a new task can be created only with the <span class="notranslate">_On hold_</span> status and you will be able to run it only when the previous task with the same URL will be completed.

Note that the URL field supports wildcard matching and you can have a case when <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is tracing the <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/*`</span> and you are trying to create a new task with <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/xray.php`</span>. In this case, you will see that warning because the `*` URLs array includes <span class="notranslate">`xray.php`</span>.

####  I started a tracing task and made requests to URL but did not see any results in the UI. What should I do?

1. Check that <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension is enabled for the domain. To do so, go to the <span class="notranslate">`phpinfo()`</span> page and make a request. In the phpinfo output try to find the following section:
   
    ![](/images/XRayPHPInfo.png)

If you cannot see that section, try to restart PHP processes for that user (the simplest way is to restart Apache) and check that you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension.


2. If you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension in the phpinfo, check that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent service is running with the service xray-agent status command. If it is not running, start it with the <span class="notranslate">`service xray-agent start`</span> command.
3. <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> may not send data if a site uses a caching plugin, as the caching plugin is outputting HTML, thus there are no PHP scripts to examine. We encountered such issues with sites that use <span class="notranslate">LSCache</span> and <span class="notranslate">WP Super Cache</span> plugins. Check that your site does not use caching plugins. If so, disable it while tracing a site to get information from <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span>.
4. If you set a client’s IP when creating the tracing task, check that your requests come to the server with this IP via phpinfo (since there may be NAT between your local machine and the server).

#### What to do if X-Ray is not found in the phpinfo() page?

If you managed to create a tracing task, this means that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> file was created in a system. Therefore, there may be two reasons why it did not appear in the phpinfo page of the domain.

1. PHP process wasn't reloaded after adding the xray.ini. To solve this, you should restart the Apache or fpm service for the domain on which the tracing was started. At the moment, this is done automatically by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager after creating the task.
2. Your domain uses a PHP version different from the one which was detected by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager. To solve this, check the scan dir for additional ini files for your domain.

    ![](/images/XRayScanDir.png)

    Then check the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> that was passed to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager by running the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # cat /usr/share/alt-php-xray/manager.log | grep ini_location
    ```
    </div>

    Find your tracing task in the output and check that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> exists in this directory, also check that the `ini` path is the same in the phpinfo page output and in the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> directive for your tracing task. If they are the same, you should reload your PHP. If they are different that means that the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager could not correctly determine the PHP version your domain uses. In this case, contact our support team at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new).


#### I use LiteSpeed, X-Ray is enabled and it is shown in the phpinfo() page but does not collect data when sending requests to a site. What to do?

Check for the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option in the `htaccess` file for your domain.
If the option is there, LiteSpeed processes requests bypassing the PHP X-Ray extension.
In this case, to get tracing information, you should remove the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option.

#### What is the proper format for the URL?

All of the examples below are correct:

* `http://domain.com`
* `http://domain.com/`
* `https://domain.com`
* `https://domain.com/`

You can use any of them with a prefix `www.` and it is also correct.
