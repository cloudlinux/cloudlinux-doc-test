### Description

:::warning Warning!
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is available out of the box for cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin. For other control panels you should implement integration as described [here](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-integrate-x-ray-with-a-control-panel)
:::

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is a tool developed for website performance monitoring and performance issues detection.

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> can gather and visualize information about top N slowest system functions, external requests, software modules and database queries of the client’s website.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have CloudLinux OS+ subscription (only non-reseller accounts apply)

2. Make sure you have installed **LVE Manager version 6.2 or later**. You can install or update it with the following commands:
   * installation

   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install lvemanager
    ```
    </div>

    * update
   
   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum update lvemanager
    ```
    </div>
3. X-Ray will be activated on all your servers during 4 hours. You will see the X-Ray tab in the LVE Manager UI.

4. For instant activation, run the following command:

   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # rhn_check
    ```
    </div>

    If the `rhn_check` command is not found, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install rhn-check rhn-setup
    ```
    </div>

5. Then install the <span class="notranslate">`alt-php-xray`</span> package

    * Via user interface
        * Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab.
        * Click <span class="notranslate">_Install_</span> to start installation.

        ![](/images/XRayUI.png)

### How to manage X-Ray

X-Ray provides two options for monitoring domain requests speed: Tracing task and Continuous task.

:::warning Warning
To use Continuous task, update your LVE Manager and alt-PHP-X-Ray packages to versions lvemanager-6.2.9-1 and alt-php-xray-0.2-1 by running the following command:
```
yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
::: 

* **Tracing task** is a task created manually for a specific URL to collect server requests. The task will end either after a specified number of requests to the URL or after a specified time (maximum after two days). It is not possible here to automatically email a report but it is possible to export the report in PDF and send to a user.

* **Continuous task** is a task that initiates a daily hourly tracing requests for a specified domain and email a monitoring report. Continuous task can't stop automatically, you need to stop it manually.

In fact, continuous task allows to automatically create a tracing task for each new day, with the ability to get a report for the past day.

#### Tracing tasks tab

The *Tracing tasks* tab contains a list of all tracing tasks created both manually and automatically via continuous tasks.

![](/images/XRayTracingTaskCreated.png)

The *Created* column shows how a task was created – automatically (by continuous task) or manually.

#### Continuous tracing tab

:::warning Warning
To use Continuous task, update your LVE Manager and alt-PHP-X-Ray packages to versions lvemanager-6.2.9-1 and alt-php-xray-0.2-1 by running the following command:
```
yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
::: 
  
The *Continuous tracing* tab contains a list of continuous tasks for which tracing tasks will be created automatically for a new day for a specific domain.

![](/images/XRayContinuousTasksList.png)

### Managing tracing task

#### Creating a new tracing task

1. Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab
2. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create a new task
3. In the opened popup specify a website URL to trace
4. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Run_</span> button
5. Tracing will run in the default mode. In the default mode <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> traces the first 20 requests for a specified URL

![](/images/XRayTracingTask.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**URL**</span> should be a valid URL of the domain which exists on the current hosting server. The URL field supports wildcard matching. To learn more about wildcard matching, click _How to use special characters_.
* <span class="notranslate">**Advanced settings**</span> allow you to set an IP address and tracing options: by time or by number of queries.

    ![](/images/XRayAdvanced.png)

**Advanced settings**

* <span class="notranslate">**Client’s IP**</span>: it is an IPv4 address of a machine to trace. For example, if you have a production website that processes requests from different IP addresses and you do not want to add these requests to the tracing task. So, you can set a specific IP address and <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will analyze requests only from this specific IP address.
Record for
* <span class="notranslate">**Time period**</span>: how much time <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> collect the requests (2 days max)
* <span class="notranslate">**Requests**</span>: the amount of requests that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will collect

After creating, the task appears in the list of tracing tasks.

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList.png)

#### Viewing tracing tasks list

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList1.png)

Tasks created *Manually* are simply tracing tasks.

#### Tracing status

A tracing task can have the following statuses:

* <span class="notranslate">**Running**</span> – tracing is in progress
* <span class="notranslate">**Stopped**</span> – tracing was stopped by administrator
* <span class="notranslate">**On hold**</span> – the same URL already exists in the lists. Task processing will not start automatically. Administrator should start it manually.
* <span class="notranslate">**Completed**</span> – period of time is finished or number of requests is reached.

#### Collected requests for tracing task

:::warning Warning!
Collected requests are available in the UI for two weeks.
:::

### End-user X-Ray plugin <Badge text="Beta"/>

:::warning Warning
To use the end-user X-Ray plugin, update your LVE Manager and X-Ray packages to the `lvemanager-6.3.9-1` and `alt-php-xray-0.3-1` by running the following command:
```
# yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
```
:::

#### How to enable/disable the end-user X-Ray plugin

You can hide or show the end-user X-Ray plugin icon by ticking or unticking the proper checkbox in the LVE Manager.

Go to _LVE Manager → Options Tab → User interface settings_.

![](/images/HideXRayAppCheckbox.png)

:::tip Note
The X-Ray plugin icon in the end-user interface is hidden when the checkbox is ticked.
:::

![](/images/XRayAppUIIcon.png)

#### How to manage the end-user X-Ray plugin

The web interface of the end-user X-Ray plugin is almost the same as the X-Ray administrator interface.

![](/images/XRayEndUserUI.png)

But there are some differences and they are described further.

* End-users can create tasks only for their domains from the drop-down list:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIStart.png)
* To specify URL or wildcard, end-users should use the input field next to the domain:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUiSpecifyURL.png)

You can read about all other basic interface elements and managing tracing tasks in the [Managing tracing task section](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#managing-tracing-task).

:::warning Note
Tracing tasks created by an end-user will also be displayed in the administrator interface and administrators can manage the end-user's tasks the same way as they manage their own. At the same time, tasks created by the administrator or other end-users will not be displayed in the UI of the current user.
:::

#### End-user X-Ray plugin limitations

* The end-user X-Ray plugin does not support creating continuous tasks.
* The end-user has a limit of tracing tasks running at a time. Before starting the next task, the end-user should wait for the completion of the previous ones or forcefully stop the running ones. Otherwise, the user will get the next error:
    
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIError.png)
    :::warning Note
    The current limit is one tracing task per user. 
    :::
* The administrator and the end-user can’t run the tracing task for the same Domain/URL at the same time. Once, the administrator started a specific tracing task, the end-user will not be able to duplicate it. And the same is true for the administrators – they will just see the running task for the specific domain and see the notification that they're trying to create a tracing task with a duplicated URL.
* If continuous tracing is enabled for the domain, the end-user will not be able to create a new task for this domain because the same rule works - it will be a duplicate of the existing tracing tasks. The next warning will appear:
    
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIWarning.png)

    To solve this, the existing running tasks for the same Domain/URL should be stopped or completed. You can find more details about this in the [FAQ](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#what-should-i-do-if-i-see-the-warning-task-is-duplicated-by-url).


### X-Ray automated throttling detection

The X-Ray automated throttling detection system checks if the account exceeds LVE limits by CPU during the HTTP request execution. 

If CPU limiting was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI that the system itself has slowed down the request processing and this is apparently not a performance issue in the PHP code.

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are indicated in the administrator/user interface of the X-Ray plugin in the following way.

![](/images/RecordedSessions.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are also marked if the administrator views the request.

![](/images/LVEFaultsMarker.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are marked in the PDF report as well.

![](/images/XRayMonitoringReport.png)


### X-Ray client

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client is a PHP extension named <span class="notranslate">`xray.so`</span>. It analyzes the processing time of the entire request and its parts and then sends the data to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent.

#### Does X-Ray affect website performance?

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> affects website performance. Our tests show 5-10 % overhead from a website loading time with <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing enabled.
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> allows you to find website performance issues and should not be enabled permanently. If your website is very slow, you can enable <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> to find the cause and then disable it.

#### What should I do if I see the warning "Task is duplicated by URL"?

This warning means that you already have a task to trace this URL in the list of your tracing tasks. If you see this warning, a new task can be created only with the <span class="notranslate">_On hold_</span> status and you will be able to run it only when the previous task with the same URL will be completed.

Note that the URL field supports wildcard matching and you can have a case when <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is tracing the <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/*`</span> and you are trying to create a new task with <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/xray.php`</span>. In this case, you will see that warning because the `*` URLs array includes <span class="notranslate">`xray.php`</span>.

####  I started a tracing task and made requests to URL but did not see any results in the UI. What should I do?

1. Check that <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension is enabled for the domain. To do so, go to the <span class="notranslate">`phpinfo()`</span> page and make a request. In the phpinfo output try to find the following section:
   
    ![](/images/XRayPHPInfo.png)

If you cannot see that section, try to restart PHP processes for that user (the simplest way is to restart Apache) and check that you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension.


2. If you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension in the phpinfo, check that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent service is running with the service xray-agent status command. If it is not running, start it with the <span class="notranslate">`service xray-agent start`</span> command.
3. <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> may not send data if a site uses a caching plugin, as the caching plugin is outputting HTML, thus there are no PHP scripts to examine. We encountered such issues with sites that use <span class="notranslate">LSCache</span> and <span class="notranslate">WP Super Cache</span> plugins. Check that your site does not use caching plugins. If so, disable it while tracing a site to get information from <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span>.
4. If you set a client’s IP when creating the tracing task, check that your requests come to the server with this IP via phpinfo (since there may be NAT between your local machine and the server).

#### What to do if X-Ray is not found in the phpinfo() page?

If you managed to create a tracing task, this means that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> file was created in a system. Therefore, there may be two reasons why it did not appear in the phpinfo page of the domain.

1. PHP process wasn't reloaded after adding the xray.ini. To solve this, you should restart the Apache or fpm service for the domain on which the tracing was started. At the moment, this is done automatically by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager after creating the task.
2. Your domain uses a PHP version different from the one which was detected by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager. To solve this, check the scan dir for additional ini files for your domain.

    ![](/images/XRayScanDir.png)

    Then check the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> that was passed to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager by running the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # cat /usr/share/alt-php-xray/manager.log | grep ini_location
    ```
    </div>

    Find your tracing task in the output and check that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> exists in this directory, also check that the `ini` path is the same in the phpinfo page output and in the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> directive for your tracing task. If they are the same, you should reload your PHP. If they are different that means that the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager could not correctly determine the PHP version your domain uses. In this case, contact our support team at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new).


#### I use LiteSpeed, X-Ray is enabled and it is shown in the phpinfo() page but does not collect data when sending requests to a site. What to do?

Check for the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option in the `htaccess` file for your domain.
If the option is there, LiteSpeed processes requests bypassing the PHP X-Ray extension.
In this case, to get tracing information, you should remove the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option.

#### What is the proper format for the URL?

All of the examples below are correct:

* `http://domain.com`
* `http://domain.com/`
* `https://domain.com`
* `https://domain.com/`

You can use any of them with a prefix `www.` and it is also correct.

#### What packages are required for X-Ray?

Required packages:

* `lvemanager` >= 6.2.10-1
* `alt-php-xray` >= 0.2-1
